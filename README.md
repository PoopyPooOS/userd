# Userd

This is a very basic daemon that handles user definitions and user authentication.

## Features

- **Simple config:** Unlike other distributions this does not use an /etc/passwd file for defining users.
  
- **Secure (probably):** Passwords will be encrypted by default but you can also use plain text passwords too.
